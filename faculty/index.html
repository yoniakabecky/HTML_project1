                    <h2>Tracy-Lea Bloch (L.I.S.T.D. Imperial Classical Ballet & Gyrotonic® Certification)</h2>
                    <p class="sub-discription">Artistic Director & Founder</p>
                    <p>Ms Bloch was born in Durban, South Africa.  At the young age of 10, she was accepted at the Durban Music & Ballet School training extensively under Duddley Von Loggenburg, Noleen Nicol and Faith Devilliers in the Cecchetti, Vaganova, and Bourneville styles of ballet.  She was promoted to soloist within her first year, performing with the Natal Youth Ballet Company (1985-1990), dancing roles from Graduation Ball, Bourneville Suite, Sleeping Beauty, Jewels, Etudes, and Raymonda.  Receiving many awards, bursaries, and achievements she chose to dance professionally and was accepted by PACT Ballet Company at the early age of 17, where she performed many traditional ballet classics such as: Giselle, Romeo & Juliette, Firebird, Le Papillon, La Fille Mal Gardée, War & Peace, various George Balanchine works, Nutcracker, and Swan Lake.  She later went on to tour South Africa with the national musical, Queen at the Opera, which concluded her 8 year professional career in classical ballet.</p>
                    <p>Ms Bloch taught classical ballet (ISTD Cecchetti Method) in South Africa for six years before moving to London, UK, in 1998, where she trained and worked as a Gyrotonic® Instructor assisting the rehabilitation of dancers to improve their strength and flexibility for further performance development.  Ms Bloch furthered her knowledge and education in training young dancers, successfully taking the Associate and Associate Diploma ISTD Professional Ballet Teaching Examinations – Imperial Faculty (with Distinction). In March 2013 she was awarded her Licentiate with Distinction.</p>
                    <p>Ms Bloch has been teaching in Canada since 2006.  She held a six year position at Pro Arte where she established their junior classical ballet division, accomplishing high standards of excellence in both examination entries, and provincial and international competitions.  She taught both junior and senior students and gained recognition with Surrey Festival of Dance, Pacific West Dance Festival, Victoria Dance Works, Peak Invitational, Festival du Ballet, Performing Arts BC, American Dance Competition, and Youth America Grand Prix (YAGP).  Over the years, many of Ms Bloch's students have successfully been accepted to summer school training at National Ballet of Canada, School of Alberta Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet School, SAB (School of American Ballet), San Francisco Ballet School, Royal Ballet School of London, Alonzo King Lines Ballet, ABT (American Ballet Theatre), Gelsey Kirkland School of Ballet and Boston Ballet School to name a few.  Ms Bloch has been teaching collectively for 19 years.</p>
                    <p>Her strength as a choreographer and rehearsal director/coach, offers young dancers the opportunity to perform at a professional level.  Her extensive teaching experience and her passion for dance education, technical training, and artistic development, is what Ms Bloch brings to every class - an inspiration for all.</p>
